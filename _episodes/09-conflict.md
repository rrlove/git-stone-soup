title: Conflicts
teaching: 15
exercises: 15
questions:
- "What do I do when my changes conflict with someone else's?"
objectives:
- "Explain what conflicts are and when they can occur."
- "Resolve conflicts resulting from a merge."
keypoints:
- "Conflicts occur when two or more people change the same file(s) at the same time."
- "The version control system does not allow people to overwrite each other's changes blindly, but highlights conflicts so that they can be resolved."

As soon as people can work in parallel, it's likely someone's going to step on someone
else's toes.  This will even happen with a single person: if we are working on
a piece of software on both our laptop and a server in the lab, we could make
different changes to each copy.  Version control helps us manage these
[conflicts]({{ page.root }}/reference/#conflicts) by giving us tools to
[resolve]({{ page.root }}/reference/#resolve) overlapping changes.

To see how we can resolve conflicts, we must first create one.  The file
`ingredients.txt` currently looks like this in both partners' copies of our `ingredients.txt`
repository:

~~~
$ cat ingredients.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
1 stone
salt
handful shriveled carrots
some old lentils
a few leftover potatoes
dried parsnips
~~~
{: .output}

Let's add a new ingredient to one partner's copy only:

~~~
$ nano ingredients.txt
$ cat ingredients.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
1 stone
salt
handful shriveled carrots
some old lentils
a few leftover potatoes
dried parsnips
stale donuts
~~~
{: .output}

and then push the change to GitHub:

~~~
$ git add ingredients.txt
$ git commit -m "What about some donuts?"
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
[master e3814e4] What about some donuts?
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ git push
~~~
{: .bash}

   7fb6b7e..e3814e4  master -> master
~~~
{: .output}

Now let's have the other partner
make a different change to their copy
*without* updating from GitHub:

~~~
$ nano ingredients.txt
$ cat ingredients.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
1 stone
salt
handful shriveled carrots
some old lentils
a few leftover potatoes
dried parsnips
thyme
~~~
{: .output}

We can commit the change locally:

~~~
$ git add ingredients.txt
$ git commit -m "I have some thyme"
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
[master 07ebc69] I have some thyme
 1 file changed, 5 insertion(+)
~~~
{: .output}

but Git won't let us push it to GitHub:

~~~
$ git push
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
To https://github.com/wanderer/stonesoup.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)

![The Conflicting Changes](../fig/conflict.svg)

Git detects that the changes made in one copy overlap with those made in the other
and stops us from trampling on our previous work.
What we have to do is pull the changes from GitHub,
[merge]({{ page.root }}/reference/#merge) them into the copy we're currently working in,
and then push that.
Let's start by pulling:

~~~
$ git pull
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1/1), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 2), reused 3 (delta 2), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.

Auto-merging ingredients.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in ingredients.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
~~~
{: .output}

`git pull` tells us there's a conflict,
and marks that conflict in the affected file:

~~~
$ cat ingredients.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
1 stone
salt
handful shriveled carrots
some old lentils
a few leftover potatoes
dried parsnips
<<<<<<< HEAD
thyme
=======
stale donuts
>>>>>>> 5fa9f4bbc64cfea4231f462afb1147b8e4703aaa
~~~
{: .output}

Our change (the one in `HEAD`) is preceded by `<<<<<<<`.
Git has then inserted `=======` as a separator between the conflicting changes
and marked the end of the content downloaded from GitHub with `>>>>>>>`.
(The string of letters and digits after that marker
identifies the commit we've just downloaded.)

It is now up to us to edit this file to remove these markers
and reconcile the changes.
We can do anything we want: keep the change made in the local repository, keep
the change made in the remote repository, write something new to replace both,
or get rid of the change entirely.

~~~
$ nano ingredients.txt
$ cat ingredients.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
1 stone
salt
handful shriveled carrots
some old lentils
a few leftover potatoes
dried parsnips
thyme
~~~
{: .output}

To finish merging,
we add `ingredients.txt` to the changes being made by the merge
and then commit:

~~~
$ git add ingredients.txt
$ git status
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
On branch master
Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:

	modified:   ingredients.txt
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ git commit -m "Save them for dessert"
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
[master 2abf2b1] Merging changes from GitHub
~~~
{: .output}

Now we can push our changes to GitHub:

~~~
$ git push
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
Counting objects: 6, done.
Delta compression using up to 24 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.

To https://github.com/wanderer/stonesoup.git
   5fa9f4b..3fec3a2  master -> master
~~~
{: .output}

Git keeps track of what we've merged with what,
so we don't have to fix things by hand again
when the collaborator who made the first change pulls again:

~~~
$ git pull
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
remote: Counting objects: 6, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 6 (delta 4), reused 6 (delta 4), pack-reused 0

We get the edited file:

~~~
$ cat ingredients
~~~

~~~

thyme
~~~

We don't need to merge again because Git knows someone has already done that.

Version control's ability to merge conflicting changes
 is another reason users tend to divide their programs and papers into
 multiple files instead of storing everything in one large file.
 There's another benefit too: whenever there are repeated conflicts
 in a particular file, the version control system is essentially trying
 to tell its users that they ought to clarify who's responsible for
 what, or find a way to divide the work up differently.

> ## A Typical Work Session
>
> You sit down at your computer to work on a shared project that is tracked in a
> remote Git repository. During your work session, you take the following
> actions, but not in this order:
>
> - *Make changes* by appending the number `100` to a text file `numbers.txt`
> - *Update remote* repository to match the local repository
> - *Celebrate* your success with beer(s)
> - *Update local* repository to match the remote repository
> - *Stage changes* to be committed
> - *Commit changes* to the local repository
>
> In what order should you perform these actions to minimize the chances of
> conflicts? Put the commands above in order in the *action* column of the table
> below. When you have the order right, see if you can write the corresponding
> commands in the *command* column. A few steps are populated to get you
